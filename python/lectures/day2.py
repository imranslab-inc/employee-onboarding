"""
there are 2 types of functions in python.
1. built-in functions: print(), input(), len(), type(), etc. defined in python interpreter
2. user defined functions: defined by user. [user=programmer]

# 4. data types

examples of data:

container/varaible/book-shelf(cell[bangla, math, history, science, random])

random variables: data is not classified

assume that: v1 has number, v2 has string, v3 has boolean, v4 has float, v5 has string, v6 has number

random v1 + random v2

Python supports various built-in data types that you can use in your programs. The following are the core data types in Python:

Numeric Types:
1. `int` (Integer): Positive or negative whole numbers
2. `float` (Floating-point): decimal numbers, with an optional fractional part.
3. `complex` (Complex Number): numbers with a real and imaginary part represented as `x + iy`, where `x` and `y` are floats and `i` is the imaginary unit.

Text Type:
4. `str` (String): A sequence of characters enclosed within a pair of single or double quotes.
Characters include: alphabets(a-z), digits(0-9), special characters(@, #, $, %, ^, -, _, +, =), etc.

Sequence Types:
5. `list` (List)
6. `tuple` (Tuple)
7. `range` (Range)

Set Types:
8. `set` (Set)
9. `frozenset` (Frozen Set)

Mapping Type:
10. `dict` (Dictionary)

Boolean Type:
11. `bool` (Boolean)

Binary Types:
12. `bytes` (Bytes)
13. `bytearray` (Byte Array)
14. `memoryview` (Memory View)

None Type:
15. `NoneType` (None)

Additionally, Python allows the creation of custom data types using classes. The standard library also provides additional types like `collections.namedtuple`, `collections.OrderedDict`, `collections.defaultdict`, etc., which are essentially built upon the base types but offer additional functionality.
